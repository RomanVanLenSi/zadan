        “What do you make of it, Holmes?”
“It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.”
“But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?”
“In this instance, none at all.”
“Why do you say 'in this instance'?”
“Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do theapocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligencewithout fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference tothe words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and whichbook I am powerless.”
“But why 'Douglas' and 'Birlstone'?”
“Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page inquestion.”
“Then why has he not indicated the book?”
“Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is thedelight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing cipherand message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are undone. Asit is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it. Our secondpost is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not bring useither a further letter of explanation, or, as is more probable, the veryvolume to which these figures refer.”
